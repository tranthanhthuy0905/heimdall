    # We have a fix in the latern service to extends the presigned url to 2 hours. However, @dkong reported the issue still
    # The issue happens when the presigned URL that is used to serve the evidence file to RTM is expired.
    # happening and we found the root cause of this issue relates to the mio.range-cacher.
    # The mio.RangeCacher extract the file as the cache key => multiple presigned URLs of same evidence file will have same
    # cache key. In the other hand, the cacher assumes the newer URL will have longer expiration than the older one, So it
    # always uses the newer URL for a cache key.
    # The logic above causes the problem when the Presigned URL which was generated from the Heimdall (when the user views
    # the evidence on EDP) has shorter expiration (60s) than the presigned URL which was generated by Lantern (7200s).
